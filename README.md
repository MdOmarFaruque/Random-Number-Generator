# Random-Nymber-Generator
The design takes a seed of 255 bit and then generatre 512 Bit rendom number utlizing Chacha20 Algorithm.
Key Features:
1. High frequency enabled due to paraller computing technique employment.
2. Deployed State Machine based RTL design.

. This random number generator is part of a PUF design for hardware security.
